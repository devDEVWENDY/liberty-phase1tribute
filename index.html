                Singer, songwriter, pianist, and civil rights activist
                <p>Nina Simone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon on February 21, 1933. She was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, composer, arranger and civil rights activist. Her music spanned styles including classical, folk, gospel, blues, jazz, R&B, and pop.</p>

                <p>She was the sixth of eight children and grew up in poverty in North Carolina. Simone initially aspired to be a concert pianist.She enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York City and applied for a scholarship to study at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Despite a well received audition, she was denied admission, which she attributed to racism. In 2003, just days before her death (April 21, 2003), the Institute awarded her an honorary degree.</p>
